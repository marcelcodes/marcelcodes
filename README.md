### üî≠ What I do
As a **Technical Writer** I turn complex IT topics into clear, actionable documentation, operator manuals, API guides, compliance notes and process docs that help teams deliver reliable services.

I am mainly creating documents and content for german government projects for the Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI), the Federal Office of Administration (BVA), the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG), the Public Health Service (√ñGD), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), state interior ministries, and municipal authorities.

### üíº Professional Experience
- Several years producing **technical documentation** and maintaining **knowledge bases** (process docs, FAQs, onboarding material)
- Direct involvement in **public-sector projects**, delivering documentation and operator-facing content for federal/state programms
- Hands-on in **IT-administration and -operation**, planned and executed server migrations for over 600 employees at once, provided scripting support and runbook automation
- Practical experience with **self-hosted infrastructure**, especially Proxmox, Docker, Portainer, VPS hosting and troubleshooting containerised services
- Strong focus on **implementable**, ops-aware docs that reduce onboarding time and prevent production errors
- Currently working full time as a Technical Writer for multiple german government projects

### üéì Education
- Professional degree as a Media Engineer/Technician
- Currently studying B.Sc. Computer Science (part-time)

<summary>ü§ñ Learn more about my involvement in AI</summary>
<br/>

I follow AI research closely and enjoy understanding models inside and out. My main interests are explainability, safe and privacy-aware deployment patterns, LLM behaviour analysis and practical AI applications.

- Member of the small and curated group of "Puzzlers" (community experts, product insiders and alpha/beta-testers) **@ OpenAI**
- Featured four times in the Community Spotlight **@ OpenAI**
- Deeply involved in prompt engineering, creating very advanced, in-depth prompts with techniques like SG-ICL, CoD, Cue-CoT, CoK and KNN
- Creating AI forensic tools to check for signs of AI generated content in texts, images, videos and audios
- Operating a local MoRE stack, running multiple specialized models in parallel on my pc to power automated multi-step troubleshooting including a generator, critic/verifier, summarizer, and retriever/embedder:
  - a MCP server exposes and governs tooling, retrieval and action endpoints
  - an orchestrator schedules requests, performs aggregation (vote/score), manages CPU/GPU offload and persists embeddings in a local vector DB (FAISS) to keep multiple experts low-latency and performant
  - leveraging a few Models I evaluate and deploy locally, mainly:
    - Mistral-7B as a high-throughput generator for draft generation and interactive response synthesis
    - Llama-3 (8B and quantized 13B variants) for instruction-following and medium-complexity reasoning / few-shot adaptation
    - Llama-4 Scout (quantized 17B active / MoE) for specialized long-context and multimodal verifier and deep reasoning expert
    - gpt-oss-20B for deep multi-step reasoning and as a critic/verifier for fact-checking and chain-of-thought verification
    - MPT-7B / Vicuna-7B for concise summarization, style adaptation and response refinement
    - sentence-transformers for dense embeddings and for semantic retrieval, similarity search and vector-DB indexing
